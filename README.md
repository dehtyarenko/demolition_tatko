- The **T43 Production Group** along with **Alejandro Jirusso Design Laboratory** recognized that the "gachi" topic is underrepresented in the Ukrainian internet space.
- This project is the second translation project on the "gachi effort" topic that was initiated in 2022.
- The objective of this project is to provide Ukrainian viewers with an authentic "gachi" plot experience in their native language through a high-quality translation.
